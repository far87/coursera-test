        <p>I've added this paragraph for another example</p>
        <div>div elements are the most generic block tags.They want 
            a line only for them.So another div element will be placed 
            on another line.
        </div>
        <div>Another div element</div>
        <span>
            Span element is the most generic inline element and this span element
            is on a new line because it follows a div element that wants the line only for him
        </span>
        <div>
            another div element 
            <span>
                This SPAN element is inline with this div element because
                it is declared inside it
            </span>
        </div>
